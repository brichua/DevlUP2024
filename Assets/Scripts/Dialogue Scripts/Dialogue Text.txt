[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Hello Mr. Bayers, how’s your day going?
[NAME=Gorgui Bayers][SPEAKERSPRITE=Gorgui Bayers]Ahhhh, nothing compared to my former days, young Evelyn. Those days of policing are behind me, I’m enjoying my more relaxed life.
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]You volunteer at Brancia’s Cat Shelter now, don’t you?
[NAME=Gorgui Bayers][SPEAKERSPRITE=Gorgui Bayers]Yes, I do! Those tiny little critters are some troublemakers sometimes. Trying to herd them away from their litter boxes to clean them does a number on my frail bones!
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Awwwww, I’m sure they make up for it with their cuteness though. I wish I could volunteer there if I had time.
[NAME=Gorgui Bayers][SPEAKERSPRITE=Gorgui Bayers]Ohhh, your time will come eventually young Evelyn. You can find happiness in any job though, just gotta put your back into it.
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Yeah, I’m trying. For now, there’s nothing too interesting about keeping the fire lit. But hey, at least it’s decently easy.
[NAME=Gorgui Bayers][SPEAKERSPRITE=Gorgui Bayers]Well, it could be worse. Could be a hard job that you hate.
[NAME=Gorgui Bayers][SPEAKERSPRITE=Gorgui Bayers]Oh, I forgot I have my juice tasting panel tomorrow. I have to start getting ready for that.
[NAME=Gorgui Bayers][SPEAKERSPRITE=Gorgui Bayers]Take care young Evelyn. Make sure to stay out of trouble. You’re still very young after all!
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Thank you Mr. Bayer, you too!
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]I mean the take care part, not the stay out of trouble part, whoops.
