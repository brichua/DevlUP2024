[NAME=Baericks Junifer][SPEAKERSPRITE=Baericks Junifer]Trinkets! Get your special trinkets! Oh, it’s you Evelyn. Here for trinkets?
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Oh, I’m just taking a look around Ms. Junifer. Find anything special as of late?
[NAME=Baericks Junifer][SPEAKERSPRITE=Baericks Junifer]Unfortunately, nothing much. I haven’t gone exploring in a while myself, and I’m still waiting for a crew I dispatched to return.
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Oh, where are they at?
[NAME=Baericks Junifer][SPEAKERSPRITE=Baericks Junifer]Oh, just sent them down south. There’s a system of caves down in that direction, they’re exploring so far.
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Yikes, that sounds a bit dangerous though.
[NAME=Baericks Junifer][SPEAKERSPRITE=Baericks Junifer]Relax, although it’s dangerous for people like us, I hired professionals. They shouldn’t go too deep either.
[NAME=Baericks Junifer][SPEAKERSPRITE=Baericks Junifer]I’m just interested if there’s anything of historical significance to document, some cave paintings, or, I don’t know, uhhhh artifacts of some kind.
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]I see, so what are you doing now?
[NAME=Baericks Junifer][SPEAKERSPRITE=Baericks Junifer]Why, uhhhhh............I am manning the shop, yes, manning the shop! This is very difficult to do, you know. So many people try to lowball me for all my trinkets, these are art!
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Welp, I’m going to take care of other things. Have fun running your drawings shop.
[NAME=Baericks Junifer][SPEAKERSPRITE=Baericks Junifer]Why of course, have a good da- WAIT, DRAWING SHOP?!?!?
