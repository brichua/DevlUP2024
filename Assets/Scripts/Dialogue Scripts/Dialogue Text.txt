[NAME=Ocetire Sakoru][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ocetire Sakoru]Well, if it isn’t our local stick and stones collector!
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]I'd roast you back, but I don’t want you to burn like your last batch of cookies.
[NAME=Ocetire Sakoru][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ocetire Sakoru]Hey, that’s a bit much, hehehe.
[NAME=Ocetire Sakoru][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ocetire Sakoru]How goes lighting up the flames or whatever you do.
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]Oh, you know, the usual, go blah blah blah with my rituals, or whatnot. It’s so repetitive these days
[NAME=Ocetire Sakoru][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ocetire Sakoru]Sounds like someone is always lazing about and whining.
[NAME=Evelyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Evelyn]I get so much free time though. You wish you had as much as me.
[NAME=Ocetire Sakoru][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ocetire Sakoru]Oh, womp womp. You wanna go get food together later today?
